# Mac fixes from playtesting

Found by playing Dashdance on an M4 Pro MacBook Pro (macOS 26) with a Mayflash adapter in Wii U mode.
Details and evidence for each are in `docs/MAC_FIXES.md`.

## Fixes

- Read the GameCube adapter when macOS rejects timed reads on its interrupt pipe (it was never read at all on this Mac).
- Quit with Cmd+Q from full screen.
- Show the adapter's measured polling rate in the HUD instead of rounding anything under 900 Hz to "125 Hz".
- Keep the launcher from crashing when a replay's player name isn't valid UTF-8.
- Fix desyncs against Dolphin players when UCF's shield drop fires. The Gecko code returns past its call site
  (return address + 8), and the recompiler now resumes the caller there instead of right after the call. A decision
  test now replays the Stadium desync's stick dive through the translated checks (25 cases), and online logs name a
  remote-input gap - the usual first domino of a desync - when it opens and on the next checksum mismatch.
- Fix the mid-match crash `guest call depth exceeded`. Guest `longjmp` unwinds as a C++ exception and skipped the
  call counter's decrement, so stage animations leaked about one level a frame until a long session hit the limit.

- The headless executable links again (it called Discord presence, which only the app has).

- A pipeline waiting in the boot-time precompile queue is compiled at once when a draw needs it. With a cold shader cache (after every app update) characters stayed invisible for up to a minute and a half while 900 pipelines compiled one at a time.

- Online games no longer end 30 s after connecting when the opponent's real port differs from the advertised one: an expired connection attempt under another address no longer marks the player as gone (docs/MAC_FIXES.md fix 9).

## Features

- Show live ping in the performance HUD during online matches.

- Recent games: every game gets two buttons, Watch (plays the replay back in a window) and Show in Finder (selects the .slp so it can be shared). Playback is the app's second executable, `DashdancePlayback`: the game translated with Slippi's playback codes and the replay code list, bundled by `tools/package_macos_app.sh` and built by `tools/mac/rebuild.sh`. Re-recordings of four online games matched the originals on every post-frame record (up to 21,860 per game).
- `--replay FILE.slp` and `--replay-codes FILE` on the Mac frontend; a replay whose code list needs another translation plays with Slippi's resync on and says so in the log.

## Logging

- Write a log file for every Mac session (no Mac session ever wrote one, so crashes left no trace).
- On a guest crash, log the guest call stack and all registers, and save guest RAM next to the session log.
  `MELEE_TEST_FATAL_RETRACE=N` triggers a fake crash to test this.
- Log every rollback (frame rolled back to, and from).
- Log the guest call depth every 60 frames, so a leak shows up long before it crashes.

- Netplay logs one `slippi: peer ...` line for every ENet connect, late connect, duplicate close and drop (slot, state, peer ids, RTT, loss, last receive, reason, whether it was the connection in use), to settle the 30-second direct-game drops (docs/MAC_FIXES.md issue 9).

## Debugging tools we built

All in `tools/mac/`, written up for agents in the `fix-logs` skill (`desync.md`, `crash.md`).

- `rebuild.sh`, `report.sh`, `unreviewed.sh`, `gcadapter_probe.cpp`: rebuild and install, capture a bug
  report, list logs nobody has read, probe the adapter.
- `desync.py`: one command to find a desync. It finds the first frame where a replay stops matching real Melee,
  checks whether Dashdance repeats it offline, compares memory at that frame, and renders what Melee shows.
- `slippi_frames.py`: renders any frame range of a replay with Slippi's own Dolphin, as ground truth.
- `dashdance_resim.py`: plays a replay back in headless Dashdance on the Mac. This builds on the existing replay
  playback, which was Windows-only: `bootstrap_port.py --playback`, headless `--replay`, and
  `MELEE_RAM_DUMP_FRAMES` to save memory at chosen frames.
- `slippi_ram.py`: saves Slippi Dolphin's game memory at chosen frames, through the debugger.
- `ramdiff.py`: compares Dashdance's and Dolphin's memory field by field (fighters, animation).
- `crashram.py`: shows what a crash's broken object is and what points at it.
- `slp.py`: small replay reader the others share.

- Simulation thread real-time budget raised from 5 to 8 ms (an M2 Pro needs 6 to 10 ms per online frame); `MELEE_RT_COMPUTE_MS` overrides it.
- Ready to compete warns when AirDrop/AirPlay (AWDL) is active on Wi-Fi, a known source of ping spikes.
- `MELEE_FORCE_CPU=<level>` and `port/scripts/cpu_match.txt`: a scripted level 9 CPU fight for measuring frame times in a real match.
- `MELEE_PHASE_SWEEP_MS`: sweeps the game/display phase to show whether latency depends on it (on an M2 Pro it does not).
- `APP_NAME=DashDance2 tools/package_macos_app.sh` packages a side-by-side copy with its own name, bundle identifier and an orange icon.
- docs/PERFORMANCE.md: M2 Pro in-match measurements; MetalFX at a fixed scale costs 3 ms of latency.

- `MELEE_PLAY_REPLAY=<n>` / `reveal:<n>`: presses a recent game's Watch or Show in Finder button (UI test aid).

- `slippi: peer health` every 5 s (unacknowledged reliable commands per ENet peer) and `MELEE_NET_DROP_CONNECT=1` (ignore incoming ENet connects, a one-way NAT) for netplay connection tests with `--local-peer`.

- Installer works on a fresh Mac: `setup.sh` fetches doldecomp/melee at the commit pinned in `tools/port_source_pins.json` (it cloned HEAD, which `bootstrap_port.py` rejects), and `install.sh` clones full history, which the Slippi file check needs.
- `setup.sh` also builds the replay playback executable, so Watch works in an app built by the installer.
- A side-by-side copy gets its orange icon without Xcode too: `tools/package_macos_app.sh` falls back to `port/app/icons/AppIcon-orange-1024.png` when `actool` is missing.

## Before opening

- Drop the "Fork workflow" section from `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/skills/fix-logs`, `.claude/skills/fix-logs` and this file.
- Set the default app name in `setup.sh` and `install.sh` (`DASHDANCE_APP_NAME`) back to `Dashdance`; the fork installs as DashDance2.
