## About this fork

This is [rkoh46's](https://github.com/rkoh46/dashdance) playtest fork of [TheAndersMadsen/dashdance](https://github.com/TheAndersMadsen/dashdance). Everything here is the original Dashdance plus fixes found by playing it on a Mac, kept on the `dashdance2` branch until they go upstream. What is different from the original:

- **Online games no longer drop 30 seconds after connecting** when the opponent's router remaps their port. An expired connection attempt to the advertised port no longer counts the player as gone.
- **Characters no longer stay invisible after an app update.** A draw whose shader is still waiting in the boot-time precompile queue compiles it at once instead of waiting up to a minute and a half.
- **Recent games can be watched.** Every recent game has a Watch button, which plays the replay back in its own window, and a Show in Finder button that selects the `.slp` so it can be shared.
- **Ready to compete warns about AirDrop and AirPlay** on Wi-Fi, a known source of ping spikes and rollbacks.
- **M2 Pro tuning:** the simulation thread's real-time budget goes from 5 to 8 ms so it stops competing with the render and audio threads.
- **GameCube adapter shutdown fixes:** the adapter is closed and its reader thread joined cleanly at exit.
- **Side-by-side install:** `tools/mac/rebuild.sh` builds and installs the fork as *DashDance2* with an orange icon and its own bundle identifier, so it can live next to the original app.
- **More netplay logging:** every ENet peer event is logged, so a dropped game can be explained from the session log.
- **The one-line installer works on a fresh Mac.** It used to stop at *"--decomp-root HEAD must equal pinned revision"*: `setup.sh` now fetches the exact doldecomp/melee commit the build is pinned to, and `install.sh` downloads the full history the build checks the Slippi files against. An install that already failed is repaired by running the installer again.

The full list, with evidence and method for each fix, is in [docs/PR.md](docs/PR.md) and [docs/MAC_FIXES.md](docs/MAC_FIXES.md). Build it the same way as the original (see [Get Dashdance](#get-dashdance)); developers rebuild with `tools/mac/rebuild.sh`.

## What's New

**Version 0.1.5-beta**

- A new name and an original icon: meet Dashdance.
- **Ready to compete:** the dashboard checks your setup and tells you what costs you milliseconds.
- **MetalFX upscaling** (new): render the game at half the internal resolution and let Apple's MetalFX reconstruct the full picture — Off, Balanced, or Quality, in the dashboard, the in-game menu, or `--upscaler`. Where the GPU budget is tight (iPhone, iPad, 4K), it keeps the image crisp at a fraction of the fill rate.
- Choose your own online input delay, from 1 frame for the lowest latency.
- Lower latency on iPhone and iPad: the display stays at full refresh while you play.
- Connect a Controller walks you through Bluetooth pairing.
- Layouts made for every screen, including iPhone Duo.
- Fixes for stale textures, a freeze when entering full screen, and the installer.

## About

Every other way to play Melee on a Mac runs a GameCube in software, one instruction at a time. Dashdance leaves the console out. The game is translated once, ahead of time, into native code for Apple silicon and drawn with Metal. What's left is Melee, fast, with your Slippi Online account built in.

### Built to compete

- **Shown on the next refresh.** Each finished frame goes to your display's very next refresh, at whatever rate your display runs.
- **Your inputs, read last.** Controllers are read right before each frame starts.
- **GameCube controllers at 1000 Hz.** Plug in a GameCube adapter for Wii U and Switch. No driver, no security changes.
- **Your delay, your call.** Pick Slippi's online input delay yourself, from 1 frame.
- **Ready to compete.** The dashboard flags a 60 Hz display, Wi-Fi instead of a cable, a slow controller, Low Power Mode and Bluetooth audio.

## Get Dashdance

**You'll need:**

- A Mac with Apple silicon (M1 or newer).
- Your own copy of Super Smash Bros. Melee (NTSC 1.02) as a disc image. Dashdance doesn't include the game.
- A free [Slippi account](https://slippi.gg) to play online.

**Install.** Open Terminal: press ⌘ Space, type *Terminal* and press Return. Paste this line and press Return:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkoh46/dashdance/dashdance2/install.sh | zsh
```

When it asks, drag your Melee disc image into the Terminal window and press Return. Dashdance builds itself on your Mac from your own disc, which takes fifteen to twenty minutes the first time. Then it's in your Applications folder as **DashDance2**, with an orange icon, and it opens. It installs next to the original Dashdance and leaves it alone, so you can keep both. To update, paste the same line again.

**If the install stopped partway** (for example with *"must equal pinned revision"* from an older version of the installer), paste the same line again. It fixes the download in `~/Dashdance` and picks up where it left off; it remembers your disc, so you won't be asked again.

**Building by hand.** Clone the full repository (not `--depth 1`: the build checks the Slippi files against a commit in its history), then run `setup.sh` with your disc. It fetches doldecomp/melee at the revision pinned in [`tools/port_source_pins.json`](tools/port_source_pins.json).

```bash
git clone --branch dashdance2 https://github.com/rkoh46/dashdance.git ~/Dashdance
~/Dashdance/setup.sh /path/to/melee.iso
```

**On iPhone or iPad.** Dashdance can't be on the App Store, because it's built from your own disc. You can still put it on your own device with AltStore, SideStore or Sideloadly. For iPhone Duo, build with Xcode 27.1 or later so it fills both displays. [See how](docs/TECHNICAL.md#iphone-and-ipad-your-own-device).

## App Privacy

**Dashdance collects no data.** It has no analytics, no tracking and no account of its own. Your disc image stays on your device.

It connects only to what it needs:

- **Slippi Online**, to sign in, load your profile and rank, and find and report matches. Slippi's sign-in runs on Google's Firebase.
- **ipify**, to show the public IP address Slippi's matchmaking sees, on the Matchmaking region card.
- **The Discord app on your Mac**, locally, when Discord presence is on.

## Questions

**Is this official?**
No. Dashdance is an independent community project. It isn't made, endorsed or supported by the Slippi team or Nintendo.

**Can I just download the app?**
No, and there will never be a download. The finished app contains Melee's code, so it has to be built from your own disc, on your own Mac.

**Can I play people who use Slippi Dolphin?**
Yes. Dashdance uses Slippi's own matchmaking and netcode.

**Does it change anything on my Mac?**
It installs Apple's developer tools and a few build tools, then builds the app. It doesn't install drivers or change your Mac's security settings.

**Something isn't working.**
Dashdance is still in alpha. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/rkoh46/dashdance/issues) on this fork and tell us what happened.

## For developers

How it works, the latency work, controller and adapter internals, device builds and building from source are in the [technical guide](docs/TECHNICAL.md). Measurements are in [PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md). Contributors and coding agents should start with [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Credits and legal

Built on the work of the [Slippi](https://slippi.gg) team, the [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org) project, [SDL](https://libsdl.org), [Aurora](https://github.com/encounter/aurora), the [doldecomp/melee](https://github.com/doldecomp/melee) contributors, and [Hero88go/melee-unlocked](https://github.com/Hero88go/melee-unlocked), the Windows build this project tracks.

The GameCube controller in the controller editor is the indigo controller from [ControllerOverlays](https://github.com/datkat21/ControllerOverlays) by Kat21 (GPL-3.0). The on-screen controller follows [VirtualFriend](https://github.com/agg23/virtualfriend) by Adam Gastineau (MIT). The Dashdance name, icon and mark are original to this project. Slippi is a trademark of its authors; Dashdance is an independent client that connects to Slippi Online and is not affiliated with it. Device frames in the images are drawn for this project. Design references: [dimillian/Skills](https://github.com/dimillian/Skills), Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, including [Designing for iPhone Duo](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-iphone-duo), and [PwrGit](https://github.com/pwrdrvr/PwrGit/pull/196) for the Icon Composer layout.

**Licence.** Dashdance is distributed under GPL-2.0-or-later, the licence of the project it forks ([Hero88go/melee-unlocked](https://github.com/Hero88go/melee-unlocked)) and of the Dolphin and Slippi Ishiiruka code it ports. Parts under other licences, and the evidence for each, are listed in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). Builds that include the controller artwork are covered by GPL-3.0.

**AI-assisted.** Much of Dashdance was written with AI coding assistants. The U.S. Copyright Office concludes that copyright does not extend to purely AI-generated material, but does protect human-authored expression, including human selection, arrangement and modification of AI output. The licence covers every part that is protected. That doesn't make the project public domain: code derived from the GPL projects it builds on stays under the GPL. Details and sources are in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md#ai-assisted-development).

Super Smash Bros. Melee is the property of Nintendo and HAL Laboratory. This repository contains no game code or data. You must supply your own legally obtained disc image. This is a factual summary, not legal advice.
